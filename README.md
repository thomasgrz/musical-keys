# Musical Keys

A fun craft project I spun up to test out Webpack5 configurations (notably how the lack of common Node polyfills affects my development flow) and the capabilities of the AnimeJS library.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install the dependencies by running `yarn` in the `musical-keys` directory, and then run `yarn start` in order to kickstart the `webpack-dev-server`.

Navigate to the port specified by `webpack-dev-server` (probably 9000)
and ~voila~ you should be able to play the Qwerty Keyboard in your favorite browser.
